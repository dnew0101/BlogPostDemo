                    While jazz may not be the most popular music, especially
                    considering its vast modal experimentation, (in contrast to
                    the pop standard of natural major and minor scales) the
                    progressive nature of jazz music has allowed it to flourish 
                    in the underground scene. It has made remarkable leaps and bounds,
                    influencing groups such as Crumb and A Tribe Called Quest, whom are 
                    amongst a top brand of independent musicians. While rudimentary jazz 
                    music may not be enjoyed by the average consumer, the influence it has 
                    in the expressiveness of indie artists is rather vast, and undeniable.

                    In conclusion, jazz is the unsung hero of modern indie music, as its 
                    influence reaches far and wide within the scene. So, next time jazz 
                    comes on the radio, pay attention for some of the influential sounds 
                    it has inspired in some of your favorite indie artists!

            <h3>Here's some food for thought:</h3>
            <p>
                A couple common scales used in place of a natural major scale would be the mixolydian and lydian mode, 
                both of which have unique tonalities that can offer great variance to a song's sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                On that same note, a couple scales used in place of the natural minor would be 
                the dorian scale and the phrygian scale. The dorian scale harbors a unique sound 
                with a modest touch of gloominess and ambiguity to its resolve. The phrygian mode 
                highlights the darker side of the minor scale, especially with its flat second scale 
                degree.
