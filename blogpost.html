                    Hi! I'm John David Newman (or simply, David Newman)! I have been a member of the Tacoma-Seattle
                    underground music scene for a little while now, so I believe my analysis of music is fairly valid. 
                    I am currently enrolled at Tacoma Community College, pursuing an Associate's Degree in Computer Engineering.

                    While jazz may not be the most popular music, especially
                    considering its vast modal experimentation, (in contrast to
                    the pop standard of natural major and minor scales) the
                    progressive nature of jazz music has allowed it to flourish 
                    in the underground scene. It has made remarkable leaps and bounds,
                    influencing groups such as Crumb and A Tribe Called Quest, whom are 
                    amongst a top brand of independent musicians. While rudimentary jazz 
                    music may not be enjoyed by the average consumer, the influence it has 
                    in the expressiveness of indie artists is rather vast, and undeniable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another key aspect of jazz music is its innate ability to relieve stress,
                    which succinctly fulfills it's influential role in the genre of indie rock.
                    An article from Live For Live Music confirmed this, stating that:
                    <blockquote cite="https://liveforlivemusic.com/features/why-jazz-is-the-most-stimulating-genre-of-music-according-to-science/">
                    "Music has a direct effect on our hormones, which is why the typical 
                    music enthusiast relies on music to lead the motions of their day. With the 
                    heart synced to the rhythms pulsating through our ear drums, it is no wonder 
                    we become sad when listening to slower, more depressing songs; or the opposite, 
                    as we become overjoyed by feelings of excitement and energy when listening to 
                    more upbeat, positively stimulating songs. This is because our hearts and our 
                    brains are intrinsically connected."</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, jazz is the unsung hero of modern indie music, as its 
                    influence reaches far and wide within the scene. So, next time jazz 
                    comes on the radio, pay attention for some of the influential sounds 
                    it has inspired in some of your favorite indie artists!

            <h3>Here's some food for thought:</h3>
            <p>
                A couple common scales used in place of a <b>natural major scale</b> would be the <b>mixolydian and lydian mode</b>, 
                both of which have unique tonalities that can offer <em>great</em> variance to a song's sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                On that same note, a couple scales used in place of the <b>natural minor</b> would be 
                the <b>dorian scale and the phrygian scale</b>. The dorian scale harbors a <em>unique sound</em> 
                with a modest touch of <u>gloominess and ambiguity to its resolve</u>. The phrygian mode 
                highlights the <u>darker side of the minor scale</u>, especially with its <u>flat second scale 
                degree</u>.
