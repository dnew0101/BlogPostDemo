# BlogPostDemo
This is the assignment for Udacity's Blog Post project. This is also my first legitimate project using github! Hooray!

I have organized my files more properly to follow the best practices for submission! I have one folder that contains CSS files, and one folder that contains my images. The html files are laid out in the parent folder for ease of access. After the amazing constructive criticisms Udacity offered, I feel as though this project now showcases a certain level of quality in design, and offers a more pleasing user experience than previous versions have. The current responsive design eliminates the empty space that was originally present in the header, as well as portions of the article.

*UPDATE*
I had to re-upload my code to this new repository. I couldn't troubleshoot what was going on exactly (VSCode was shooting errors each time I tried to push the new code to GitHub). So, it appears as though I magically wound up with all this code, when in fact the majority of my Version Control is in the "BlogPostDemo" repository.

To clarify, this is the issue I'm having:
