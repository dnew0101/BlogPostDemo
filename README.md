# BlogPostDemo
This is the assignment for Udacity's Blog Post project. This is also my first legitimate project using github! Hooray!

I have divided the folder into 4 separate files; an index.html for the layout, and 3 css files which isolate styling, grid, and flex box. This made it easier for me to diagnose bugs when they would occur, as well as focus on one area of css at a time.
