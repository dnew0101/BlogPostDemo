# BlogPostDemo
This is the assignment for Udacity's Blog Post project. This is also my first legitimate project using github! Hooray!

I have divided the folder into 6 separate files; an index.html for the layout, and 3 css files which isolate styling, grid, and flex box. I also have a homepage.html for the homepage, as well as corresponding CSS files linked to it. This made it easier for me to diagnose bugs when they would occur, as well as focus on one area of css at a time. Though there were areas/bugs I couldn't quite figure out this time around. I do plan to come back to this assignment after the Udacity course to polish up my errors, as well as to challenge my future self to create something more responsive, and more advanced.
